# hello-world
Testing things out...

I started programming on a C64 in 1988. I have been developing software professionally since 1996. Currently my main language is Python, and I think I will stick to it for quite some time, it is a very powerful language once you understand it.

Now I have also started to use the atom editor. I hope I will be able to
use it with github also.
